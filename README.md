# ANN Regression model to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant.
This project focuses on developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression model to predict the electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP). The CCPP is a highly efficient system that generates electricity using multiple cycles of heat and power. By analyzing various input features such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, the ANN model will estimate the energy output. The model will be trained and evaluated using a dataset, and its performance will be assessed using appropriate regression metrics.
